📈 Stock Market Backtesting with Key Technical Indicators

🧐 What is Backtesting?
Backtesting is a method used to evaluate the performance of a trading strategy or investment approach by testing it on historical data. It helps traders and investors understand how their strategy would have performed in the past and provides insights into its potential future performance.

🔍 Technical Indicators Overview
In our backtesting tool, we use popular technical indicators to analyze stock price trends and make informed decisions. Here's a brief explanation of the indicators and the risk types you can select:

🟢 1. Bollinger Bands

📜 Description:
Bollinger Bands are a set of three lines plotted on a stock chart:

The middle line is a Simple Moving Average (SMA).
The upper and lower bands are calculated based on the stock's price volatility.
⚙️ How it works:

Buy Signal: When the stock price touches or moves below the lower band, it may indicate the stock is oversold (a good time to buy).
Sell Signal: When the price touches or exceeds the upper band, it may indicate the stock is overbought (a good time to sell).
🛠 Use Case:
Helps identify periods of high or low volatility and potential reversal points.

🟡 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

📜 Description:
RSI measures the strength and speed of a stock's price movements on a scale of 0 to 100.

⚙️ How it works:

Overbought Signal: If RSI > 70, the stock may be overbought, indicating a potential price drop.
Oversold Signal: If RSI < 30, the stock may be oversold, indicating a potential price increase.
🛠 Use Case:
Detects momentum and helps identify when a stock is due for a price correction or rally.

🔵 3. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

📜 Description:
VWAP represents the average price of a stock, weighted by its trading volume over a given period.

⚙️ How it works:

Above VWAP: When the price is above VWAP, it indicates the stock is in an uptrend.
Below VWAP: When the price is below VWAP, it indicates a downtrend.
🛠 Use Case:
Often used by traders to determine if the stock is trading at a fair value compared to its average price.

⚖️ Risk Levels
When performing backtesting, you can choose a risk type based on your trading style:

🔴 Aggressive:
Focuses on high-risk, high-reward strategies.
Trades frequently and aims for higher returns but with higher volatility.

🟠 Moderate:
Balances risk and reward.
Trades cautiously with a mix of conservative and aggressive strategies.

🟢 Low:
Prioritizes safety and minimizes risk.
Trades conservatively, focusing on steady, long-term gains.
